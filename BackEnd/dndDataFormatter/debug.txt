Failure means the target loses the use of their legs (stuck in the {@condition prone} position) or their arms (unable to cast spells or engage in attacks; lose any AC bonus from shields). Baalzebul decides whether he targets arms or legs before making the attack roll. This withering effect lasts for one minute but at the end of each of their turns the afflicted creature may repeat the saving throw.
Baalzebul activates a gaze attack and triggers two effects on everyone within 50 feet of him. The first requires a {@dc 21} Charisma saving throw; failure means the target is {@condition frightened} of Baalzebul as per the {@spell fear} spell.

While {@condition restrained}, the target takes 9 ({@damage 2d8}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns and the target may then make a {@dc 17} Strength check to free itself from the webbing. Unlike normal webs, fire cannot burn a bebilith's webbing but if used will ignite the web inflicting an additional 3 ({@damage 1d6}) fire damage to trapped targets.

During its first turn, the slayer has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the slayer scores against a {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} creature is a critical hit.
As a bonus action the slayer focuses on a single creature it can see within 60 feet. Afterwards, the first time each turn that the slayer hits that creature, the slayer does an additional 7 ({@damage 2d6}) damage.
{@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d8 + 7}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the {@spell greater restoration} spell or other magic.
If the slayer has killed a creature of CR/level 5 or greater that it previously marked with its Prey ability in the last minute, it can transform into its {@creature Bhaal, Ravager|MaBJoV|Ravager form}. The form lasts until dawn (minimum 1 hour).
Bodhi deals an extra 28 ({@damage 8d6}) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of Bodhi that isn't incapacitated and Bodhi doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Bodhi's heart while she is {@condition incapacitated} in her resting place, Bodhi Irenicus the vampire is {@condition paralyzed} until the stake is removed.
If Bodhi is destroyed, her body immediately appears in her resting place. She is {@condition paralyzed} until she regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 24 hours in her resting place with 0 Hit Points, she regains 1 hit point. While {@condition paralyzed} in this manner, if a creature within 60 ft. says her name 9 times, Bodhi is permanently destroyed.
{@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Bodhi Irenicus can grapple the target (escape {@dc 18}).
{@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d6 + 5}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Bodhi Irenicus regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Bodhi's control.
Bodhi Irenicus targets one humanoid she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see Bodhi, the target must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be {@condition charmed} by Bodhi. The {@condition charmed} target regards the Bodhi as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Bodhi's control, it takes Bodhi's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time Bodhi Irenicus or her companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Bodhi Irenicus is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

The target receives no saving throw and suffers 22 ({@damage 5d8}) cold damage immediately and at the start of each of their turns. The target is considered {@condition stunned} but is partly protected by the shroud so is resistant to all damage. The shroud disappears if Cryonax removes it, Cryonax dies, the shroud takes 100 hit points of damage or another character uses their action and succeeds against a {@dc 22} Strength check to remove the trapped ally.

1. Beguiling Gaze. The target is {@condition stunned} until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.
2. Hypnotic Gaze. The target is {@condition charmed} by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn.

3. Insanity Gaze. The target suffers the effect of the {@spell confusion} spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.

The oblex can impersonate {@dice 2d6 + 1} different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed.

While memory drained, the target must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the {@dice d4} becomes a {@dice d6}, the {@dice d6} becomes a {@dice d8}, and so on until the die becomes a {@dice d20}, at which point the target becomes {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour. The effect then ends.
The tempest is always at the center of a storm {@dice 1d6 + 4} miles in diameter. Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain or snow falls there, causing the area to be lightly obscured. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing.
{@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 4d6 + 9}) thunder damage.
All other creatures within 120 feet of the tempest must each make a {@dc 20} Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 ({@damage 6d8}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a target's saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also {@condition stunned} until the end of its next turn.
The tempest can cause a bolt of lightning to strike a point on the ground anywhere under its storm. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a {@dc 20} Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 ({@damage 3d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The tempest releases a blast of thunder and wind in a line that is 1 mile long and 20 feet wide. Objects in that area take 22 ({@damage 4d10}) thunder damage. Each creature there must succeed on a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw or take 22 ({@damage 4d10}) thunder damage and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown target collides with an immovable object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact. If the target would collide with another creature instead, that other creature must succeed on a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked {@condition prone}.

The salamander exhales chill wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw, taking 44 ({@damage 8d10}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
{@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}23 ({@damage 4d6 + 9}) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is {@condition grappled} ({@dc 24}) and is {@condition restrained} until the grapple ends. Geryon can grapple one creature at a time.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the poison damage it takes. If its hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. This reduction lasts until the {@condition poisoned} condition is removed.
Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. If the target can see Geryon, the target must succeed on a {@dc 23} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of Geryon until the end of its next turn.

{@atk mw} {@hit 12} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d6 + 7}) slashing damage plus 17 ({@damage 5d6}) psychic damage. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the {@spell astral projection} spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
The githyanki magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it. It also becomes insubstantial until the start of its next turn. While insubstantial, it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.

The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls {@condition prone} and takes 28 ({@damage 8d6}) bludgeoning damage.
If the hellfire engine remains in the {@condition prone} creature's space, the creature is also {@condition restrained} until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While {@condition restrained} in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a {@dc 18} Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer {@condition restrained}.
If the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in {@dice 1d4} hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a {@spell wish} spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life.

While a creature is {@condition frightened} in this way, its speed is halved, and it is {@condition incapacitated}. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.
{@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d6 + 8}) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned}.

On a successful save, the target becomes immune to this hydroloth's Steal Memory for 24 hours. On a failed save, the target loses all proficiencies, it can't cast spells, it can't understand language, and if its Intelligence and Charisma scores are higher than 5, they become 5. Each time the target finishes a long rest, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A {@spell greater restoration} or {@spell remove curse} spell cast on the target ends this effect early.
{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw or suffer one random poison effect:

On a failure, the target takes 55 ({@damage 10d10}) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent −1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent −1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to −5, the object is destroyed.
Juiblex casts {@spell acid splash}.
{@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}21 ({@damage 4d6 + 7}) poison damage, and the target is slimed.

While submerged, the leviathan magically creates a wall of water centered on itself. The wall is up 250 feet long, up to 250 feet high, and up to 50 feet thick. When the wall appears, all other creatures within its area must each make a {@dc 24} Strength saving throw. A creature takes 33 ({@damage 6d10}) bludgeoning damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
At the start of each of the leviathan's turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any other creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from the leviathan. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a {@dc 24} Strength saving throw or take 27 ({@damage 5d10}) bludgeoning damage. A creature takes this damage no more than once on a turn.

When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the effect ends.
A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful {@dc 24} Strength (Athletics) check to swim at all during that turn.

Each target must succeed on a {@dc 20} Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil. A target fails automatically if it is {@condition incapacitated}. If either target is teleported in this way, the marut teleports with it to the circle.

Moloch exhales in a 30-foot cube. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 21} Wisdom saving throw or take 27 ({@damage 5d10}) psychic damage, drop whatever it is holding, and become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. While {@condition frightened} in this way, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from Moloch by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the Dash action. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to Moloch, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.
Moloch casts {@spell stinking cloud}.
{@atk mw} {@hit 16} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 2d10 + 9}) slashing damage.

This transformation can be ended only by a {@spell wish} spell.
A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice ({@dice d8}s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 ({@dice 1d6}) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a {@spell wish} spell.

On a successful save, the target becomes immune to the nagpa's Corruption for the next 24 hours.
As a bonus action, the nagpa forces each creature within 30 feet of it to succeed on a {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition paralyzed} for 1 minute.

The carrionette gains control of the target's body, and the target is {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour, after which it gains control of the carrionette's body. While controlling the target's body, the carrionette retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
If the carrionette's body is destroyed, both the carrionette and the target die. A {@spell protection from evil and good} spell cast on the controlled body drives the carrionette out and returns the consciousness of both creatures to their original bodies. The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the carrionette's Silver Needle.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Zorak regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces his hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a {@creature vampire spawn} under Zorak's control.
Zorak targets one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of it.

On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual).

If a creature starts its turn within 15 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't {@condition incapacitated}. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is {@condition restrained}. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is {@condition petrified} until freed by the  {@spell greater restoration} spell or other magic.
A creature that isn't {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of Ebondeath that can see it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages {@dice 1d4 × 10} years. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the {@condition frightened} condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this Ebondeath's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a {@spell greater restoration} spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
One humanoid that Ebondeath can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 20} Charisma saving throw or be possessed by Ebondeath; Ebondeath then disappears, and the target is {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of its body.

The babau targets one creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
{@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 5d6 + 5}) piercing damage, and the target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 15}) if it is a Large or smaller creature.

The banderhobb makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the banderhobb and it takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb's turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way stops taking necrotic damage and becomes stable.
The banderhobb can have only one target swallowed at a time. While the banderhobb isn't {@condition incapacitated}, it can regurgitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space within 5 feet of it. The creature exits {@condition prone}. If the banderhobb dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature.

The barghest has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on smell.
While a humanoid's soul is trapped in a barghest, any form of revival that could work has only a {@chance 50|50 percent} chance of doing so, freeing the soul from the barghest if it is successful. Once a creature's soul is digested, however, no mortal magic can return that humanoid to life.

Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} of her for 1 minute. While {@condition frightened} in this way, a creature is {@condition incapacitated}, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.

When a creature that can see the bodak's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the bodak, the bodak can force it to make a {@dc 13} Constitution saving throw if the bodak isn't {@condition incapacitated} and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, unless it is immune to the {@condition frightened} condition. Otherwise, a creature takes 16 ({@damage 3d10}) psychic damage on a failed save.
Unless {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn.

As a bonus action, the boggle can create an {@condition invisible} and immobile rift within an opening or frame it can see within 5 feet of it, provided that the space is no bigger than 10 feet on any side. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 30 feet of it that the boggle can see or specify by distance and direction (such as "30 feet straight up"). While next to the rift, the boggle can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the boggle puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only the boggle can use the rift, and it lasts until the end of the boggle's next turn.

If the oil is slippery, any creature that enters the puddle's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a {@dc 11} Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone}.
If the oil is sticky, any creature that enters the puddle's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a {@dc 11} Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained}.

The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the filament is {@condition grappled} by the cave fisher (escape {@dc 13}), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful {@dc 13} Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament causes no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement filament on its next turn

The shadow mastiff has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
While in dim light or darkness, the shadow mastiff can use a bonus action to become {@condition invisible}, along with anything it is wearing or carrying.

While {@condition poisoned}, the target is also {@condition paralyzed}. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
In the first round of a combat, the slithering tracker has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}.
While the slithering tracker remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a puddle, unless an observer succeeds on a {@dc 18} Intelligence (Investigation) check.
{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d10 + 3}) bludgeoning damage.
One Large or smaller creature that the slithering tracker can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained} and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. In addition, the {@condition grappled} target takes 16 ({@damage 3d10}) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The slithering tracker can grapple only one target at a time.
A worm launches from the spawn of Kyuss at one humanoid that the spawn can see within 10 feet of it. The worm latches onto the target's skin unless the target succeeds on a {@dc 11} Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target's skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use this action to launch a scraped-off worm at a humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target's skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing 1 piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of {@dice 10d6}). A worm-infested target dies if it drops to 0 hit points, then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested creature is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.
{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) slashing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage.

Any creature other than a stench kow that starts its turn within 5 feet of the stench kow must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all stench kows for 1 hour.
{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d6 + 4}) piercing damage.
An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant must make a {@dc 13} Charisma saving throw, provided that the giant isn't {@condition incapacitated}. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition charmed} by the giant. A creature {@condition charmed} in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the saving throw, the creature is immune to this giant's Dreamwalker's Charm for 24 hours.
{@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.
The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that is {@condition charmed} by it. The target must make a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes {@condition petrified}, and the giant can adhere the target to its stony body. {@spell Greater restoration} spells and other magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a {@condition petrified} creature on the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally, freeing the {@condition petrified} creature as well as ending the {@condition petrified} condition on it.
{@atk rw} {@hit 10} to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.
{@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}40 ({@damage 9d6 + 9}) lightning damage.
The giant coalesces wind into a javelin-like form and hurls it at a creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The javelin is considered a magic weapon and deals 19 ({@damage 3d6 + 9}) piercing damage to the target, striking unerringly. The javelin disappears after it hits.
The giant targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates a magical gust of wind around it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in any horizontal direction the giant chooses.
The giant hurls a thunderbolt at a creature it can see within 600 feet of it. The target must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@damage 4d10}) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The giant vanishes, dispersing itself into the storm surrounding its lair. The giant can end this effect at the start of any of its turns, becoming a giant once more and appearing in any location it chooses within its lair. While dispersed, the giant can't take any actions other than lair actions, and it can't be targeted by attacks, spells, or other effects. The giant can't use this ability outside its lair, nor can it use this ability if another creature is using a {@spell control weather} spell or similar magic to quell the storm.
{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. {@h}14 ({@damage 4d6}) piercing damage, or 7 ({@damage 2d6}) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
{@atk mw} {@hit 0} to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. {@h}The target is infested by {@dice 1d4} rot grubs. At the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes {@dice 1d6} piercing damage per rot grub infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target.
{@atk mw,rw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d4 + 4}) piercing damage.

{@atk mw} {@hit 2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}2 ({@damage 1d6 - 1}) bludgeoning damage, or 3 ({@damage 1d8 - 1}) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
While the trapper is attached to a ceiling, floor, or wall and remains motionless, it is almost indistinguishable from an ordinary section of ceiling, floor, or wall. A creature that can see it and succeeds on a {@dc 20} Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Nature) check can discern its presence.
One Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of the trapper must succeed on a {@dc 14} Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 17 ({@damage 4d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. While {@condition grappled} in this way, the target is {@condition restrained}, {@condition blinded}, and at risk of suffocating. The trapper can smother only one creature at a time.
The ulitharid is aware of the presence of creatures within 2 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a {@spell mind blank} spell, a {@spell nondetection} spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.
{@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}27 ({@damage 4d10 + 5}) psychic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}) and must succeed on a {@dc 17} Intelligence saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until this grapple ends.
{@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one {@condition incapacitated} humanoid {@condition grappled} by the ulitharid. {@h}55 ({@damage 10d10}) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the ulitharid kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.
The ulitharid magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 17} Intelligence saving throw or take 31 ({@damage 4d12 + 5}) psychic damage and be {@condition stunned} for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
{@atk mw} {@hit 4} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 1d6 + 2}) piercing damage plus 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage.
The vargouille kisses one {@condition incapacitated} humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a {@spell daylight} spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting {@spell remove curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.
The vargouille shrieks. Each humanoid and beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a {@dc 12} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While {@condition frightened} in this way, a target is {@condition stunned}. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.

A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vegepygmy. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area that isn't a plant must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned}.

A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A target that successfully saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours.
Any creature of the anathema's choice, other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the anathema and can see or hear it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of snakes and yuan-ti.

While memory drained, the target must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from its ability checks and attack rolls. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the {@dice d4} becomes a {@dice d6}, the {@dice d6} becomes a {@dice d8}, and so on until the die becomes a {@dice d20}, at which point the target becomes {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour. The effect then ends.

While {@condition frightened} in this way, the creature must take the {@action Dash} action and move away from the eidolon by the safest available route at the start of each of its turns, unless there is nowhere for it to move, in which case the creature also becomes {@condition stunned} until it can move again. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any eidolon's Divine Dread for the next 24 hours.
The elder brain is aware of creatures within 5 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each one's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a {@spell mind blank} spell, a {@spell nondetection} spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.
{@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. {@h}20 ({@damage 4d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 15}) and takes 9 ({@damage 1d8 + 5}) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets {@condition grappled} at a time.
Creatures of the elder brain's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 18} Intelligence saving throw or take 32 ({@damage 5d10 + 5}) psychic damage and be {@condition stunned} for 1 minute.

The target must succeed on a {@dc 18} Wisdom saving throw or take 44 ({@damage 8d10}) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the {@spell greater restoration} or {@spell heal} spell. Constructs, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.
While memory drained, the target must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the {@dice d4} becomes a {@dice d6}, the {@dice d6} becomes a {@dice d8}, and so on until the die becomes a {@dice d20}, at which point the target becomes {@condition unconscious} for 1 hour. The effect then ends.
The tempest doesn't provoke {@action opportunity attack||opportunity attacks} when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
The tempest is always at the center of a storm {@dice 1d6 + 4} miles in diameter. Heavy precipitation in the form of either rain or snow falls there, causing the area to be lightly obscured. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing. In addition, strong winds swirl in the area covered by the storm. The winds impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. They also extinguish open flames and disperse fog.

Each creature there must succeed on a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw or take 22 ({@damage 4d10}) thunder damage and be flung up to 60 feet in a direction away from the line. If a thrown target collides with an immovable object (such as a wall or floor) or another creature, the target takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact. If the target collides with another creature, that other creature must succeed on a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw or take the same impact damage and be knocked {@condition prone}.

The evoker unleashes a magical explosion of a particular damage type: cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The magic erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 150 feet of the evoker. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 15} Dexterity saving throw. The evoker can select up to three creatures it can see in the area to ignore the spell, as the evoker sculpts the spell's energy around them. On a failed save, a creature takes 40 ({@damage 9d8}) damage of the chosen type and is knocked {@condition prone}.

The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls {@condition prone} and takes 28 ({@damage 8d6}) bludgeoning damage.
If the hellfire engine remains in the {@condition prone} creature's space, the creature is also {@condition restrained} until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While {@condition restrained} in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a {@dc 18} Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer {@condition restrained}.

Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or take 16 ({@damage 3d10}) psychic damage and be {@condition frightened} until the end of the howler's next turn. While a creature is {@condition frightened} in this way, its speed is halved, and it is {@condition incapacitated}.

On a failed save, the target loses all proficiencies; it can't cast spells; it can't understand language; and if its Intelligence and Charisma scores are higher than 5, they become 5. Each time the target finishes a long rest, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Unless the target avoids taking all of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent −1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon the target is carrying or wearing takes a permanent −1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to −5, the object is destroyed.

The morkoth projects a 30-foot cone of magical energy. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is {@condition charmed} by the morkoth for 1 minute. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the target tries to get as close to the morkoth as possible, using its actions to {@action Dash} until it is within 5 feet of the morkoth. A {@condition charmed} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws against the morkoth's Hypnosis for 24 hours.

A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a Construct nor an Undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 ({@damage 1d6}) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a {@spell wish} spell.
{@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}38 ({@damage 5d12 + 6}) necrotic damage.

The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the nabassu regains hit points equal to half that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a Humanoid, it immediately rises as a {@creature ghoul} under the nabassu's control.

If this damage kills a creature with a soul, the soul rises from the River Styx as a {@creature lemure} in Avernus in {@dice 1d4} hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a {@spell wish} spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.
Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can't be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened} until the end of the narzugon's next turn.

While on the target's skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use Burrowing Worm to launch a scraped-off worm at a Humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target's skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing 1 piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 1 Od6), and if it drops to 0 hit points, it dies and then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss.

A {@condition frightened} target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hound must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the hound as possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours.

Any creature of the anathema's choice, other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the anathema must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of snakes and yuan-ti. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The creepy doll targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Intelligence saving throw or take 11 ({@damage 2d10}) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll {@dice 3d6}. If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is {@condition stunned} until it regains at least one point of Intelligence, as from the {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic.
The creepy doll initiates an Intelligence contest with an {@condition incapacitated} humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the creepy doll's spirit inhabits the target's body while the target's spirit is placed into the creepy doll's body. The creepy doll controls the target's body completely. It retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The target retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while inhabiting the creepy doll's body.
The body exchange lasts until the doll's spirit is forced out by magic. (The {@spell dispel evil and good} spell will accomplish this, though the doll is not one of the creature types whose possession that spell normally ends.) The body and the doll must be within 5 feet of each other for such an effect to work. The target is immune to this doll's Body Exchange for 24 hours after winning the Intelligence contest or after the exchange ends.
The geist can move through other creatures and objects as if they were {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. It takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
A living creature possessed by a white-aligned geist gains immunity to the {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened} conditions, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. While the creature is possessed, the geist can allow it to take control of its body, but the geist can regain control at any time (no action required).
Black-aligned geists can make themselves terrible to behold, even when they are possessing the living. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the geist that can see it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages {@dice 1d4 × 10} years. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the {@condition frightened} condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this geist's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a {@spell greater restoration} spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
{@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target {@h}17 ({@damage 4d6 + 3}) necrotic damage.
One creature that the geist can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the geist; the geist then disappears, and the target is {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of its body. The geist now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The geist can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the geist ends it as a bonus action, or the geist is turned or forced out by an effect like the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, the geist reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this geist's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. The geist can instead target the corpse of a creature, effectively using its own life force to animate the corpse as a zombie. The animated corpse uses zombie statistics and returns to death if the geist ends the possession.
Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a {@dice d6}. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.
The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a {@dc 15} Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.
The skaab has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks and on saving throws against being {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition stunned}, and knocked {@condition unconscious}. (Its challenge rating doesn't change.)

{@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is {@condition grappled} by the vampire, {@condition incapacitated}, or {@condition restrained}. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d6 + 3}) piercing damage plus 7 ({@damage 2d6}) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
The vampire obscures its form with mind-affecting magic that makes others perceive it as a beautiful human of the same size and shape. The illusion ends if the vampire takes a bonus action to end it or if the vampire dies. A creature that can see the vampire can take an action to visually inspect it, ending the mental effect on itself and seeing the vampire's true form with a successful {@dc 20} Wisdom (Perception) check.
The vampire shrouds itself in a cloak of silence to a radius of 2 feet. Within that radius, the effect is the same as the {@spell silence} spell.
The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

Vecna carries a magic dagger named Afterthought. In the hands of anyone other than Vecna, Afterthought is a {@item +2 dagger}.
If Vecna is slain, his soul refuses to accept its fate and lives on as a disembodied spirit that fashions a new body for itself after {@dice 1d100} years. Vecna's soul can fashion a new body even if its old body was burned to ash or otherwise obliterated. When the new body is complete, Vecna regains all his hit points and becomes active again. Vecna's new body appears anywhere within 100 miles of where Vecna was slain.
Vecna uses Flight of the Damned (if available), Rotten Fate, or Spellcasting. He then makes two attacks with {@i Afterthought}.
{@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d4 + 5}) piercing damage, plus 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it is afflicted by entropic magic, taking 9 ({@damage 2d8}) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Until it succeeds on this save, the afflicted target can't regain hit points.
Vecna conjures a torrent of flying, spectral entities that fill a 120-foot cone and pass through all creatures in that area before dissipating. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 36 ({@damage 8d8}) necrotic damage and is {@condition frightened} of Vecna for 1 minute. On a failed save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition frightened}. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Vecna causes necrotic magic to engulf one creature he can see within 120 feet of himself. The target must make a {@dc 22} Constitution saving throw, taking 96 ({@damage 8d8 + 60}) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this magic rises as a {@creature zombie} at the start of Vecna's next turn and acts immediately after Vecna in the initiative order. The {@creature zombie} is under Vecna's control.
{@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d8 + 5}) slashing damage plus 14 ({@damage 4d6}) necrotic damage. The abhorrent overlord regains hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt if the target is a creature.
The abhorrent overlord conjures a swarm of spectral crows and harpies in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the overlord can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere remains for 1 minute or until the overlord loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), and its area is lightly obscured and {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.
Any creature that moves into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 16 ({@damage 3d10}) slashing damage plus 16 ({@damage 3d10}) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
While the hoplite is holding a spear, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from the hoplite when they move within 5 feet of it.

Aphemia shrieks a cacophony of magical sounds. Each humanoid within 120 feet of her must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} of her until the song ends. A {@condition frightened} creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) psychic damage at the start of its turn while Aphemia is singing. A {@condition frightened} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Aphemia's Discordant Song for the next 24 hours. Aphemia must take a bonus action on her subsequent turns to continue singing. She can stop singing at any time. The song ends if Aphemia is {@condition incapacitated} or dies.
Aphemia intones a low, growling magical melody. Every undead within 300 feet of her must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or fall under her control until the song ends.

Each creature {@condition restrained} by Arasta's Web of Hair takes 18 ({@damage 4d8}) poison damage.
If the archon isn't mounted, it can use a bonus action to magically teleport onto the creature serving as its mount, provided the archon and its mount are on the same plane of existence. When it teleports, the archon appears astride the mount, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying. While mounted and not {@condition incapacitated}, the archon can't be {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised}, and both it and its mount have advantage on Dexterity saving throws. If the archon is reduced to 0 hit points while riding its mount, the mount is reduced to 0 hit points as well.
If the archon is reduced to 0 hit points, it regains 30 hit points and springs back to its feet with a burst of radiance. Each creature of the archon's choice within 30 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Constitution saving throw, or the creature takes 13 ({@damage 3d8}) radiant damage and is {@condition blinded} until the start of the archon's turn.
